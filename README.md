# Memory-Explotation
In this challenge, we will need to find, and jump to a win function. This win function will read in the flag, and print it. Find it! Then use it to get the flag!

Welcome to the BabyStack problem set! This challenge is part of a series where you'll be working with memory corruption techniques. Your goal is to find and jump to a specific "win" function within the program's memory. This win function reads and prints the flag, and your task is to obtain the flag by manipulating the program's memory.

Challenge Overview:
1. Objective: Find and jump to the win function.
2. Memory Corruption: You'll be manipulating the program's memory to achieve the desired outcome.
3. Defenses and Stack Layout: The challenge may have various defenses turned on, and the stack layout might change, adding complexity to the task.
4. Flag Retrieval: Once you've located the win function, use it to obtain the flag.
Feel free to explore and experiment with different memory corruption techniques to solve this challenge. Good luck!
